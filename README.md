# About this Repository

This repository contains facts about the GME stock, as well as explanations of concepts and topics from the finance and investing world that commonly occur in [/r/superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/superstonk) threads. All information is provided together with reliable sources.

# Contents

* [Concepts and Terms Explained](https://github.com/lantilecucumber/stonkinfo/blob/main/Concepts%20and%20Terms%20.md)  
    Explanations of concepts and terms from the finance world that might be of interest to fellow apes and apettes.
* [Information regarding the GME Stock](https://github.com/lantilecucumber/stonkinfo/blob/main/GME%20Stock%20Info%20.md)  
    Currently only officially reported DRS numbers, but other data like revenue numbers would fit here well (feel free to provide, see *Contributing* below). 

# Aims
* Provide a place to gather information regarding the stonk in a structured way.
* Provide a safe place to look up stonk information, reducing the need to rely on information from reddit posts (simply because these understandably lack sources all to often).
* Spare apes some research time, since research could lead to growing wrinkles, eventually resulting in an evolutionary step towards the uranus sapiens. That must be avoided at all cost. Actually, the opposite is true: I am glad for any ape or apette who can use this repository as a starting point for research, or even contribute and help me and others grow some wrinkles.
* As opposed to [/r/superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/superstonk) and the DD, there is no place for speculation or complex theories here. Instead, this repository is aimed at providing easily verifiable information that helps us understand the DD posts with the theories they introduce.

# Contributing

Feel free to provide pull requests, either for an existing issue, or for any content you deem worthy for this repository. It can easily take some days for me to review PRs, but I will do. PRs without sources are not accepted. I am, however, glad about anyone simply adding more sources to a topic. Also, when you find any mistakes, please let me know.

If there is a concept or term that you would like to have explained in this repository, please open an issue, or send me a direct message in reddit (/u/lettuchhy).

**In case you don't know how to use github, you can just send me your contributions and requests via dm in reddit, instead of opening an issue or PR here. Please add all links to relevant sources, so that I can verify the information before adding it to this repository.**

Mirror and fork this repository as you like. I might also give write access to other apes that I can trust to provide well sauced content.
