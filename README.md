# About

The aim of this repository is to provide information, together with sources, about concepts and topics that are commonly occuring in [/r/superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/superstonk) threads. Hopefully it can spare some apes some research time, since research could lead to growing wrinkles, eventually resulting in an evolutionary step towards the uranus sapiens. That must be avoided at all cost.

Feel free to provide pull requests, either for an existing issue, or for any content you deem worthy for this repository. It can easily take days or even weeks for me to review, but I will do. PRs without sources are not accepted. I am also glad about any PRs that simply adds more sources to an explained concept.

When you would like to have a concept explained, please open an issue in this repository, or send me a direct message on reddit (/u/lettuchhy).
