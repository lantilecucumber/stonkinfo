# About

The aim of this repository is to provide information, together with sources, about concepts and topics that are commonly occuring in [/r/superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/superstonk) threads. Hopefully it can spare some apes some research time, since research could lead to growing wrinkles, eventually resulting in an evolutionary step towards the uranus sapiens. That must be avoided at all cost.

Feel free to provide pull requests. It can easily take days or even weeks for me to review, but I will do. PRs without sources are not accepted. I am also glad about any PRs that simply adds more sources to an explained concept.

When you would like to have a concept explained, please open an issue in this reposiutory, or send me a direct message on reddit (/u/lettuchhy).

# Concepts and Terms Explained

### Utilization

Utilization := Number of shares borrowed / Number of shares available to borrow

Note that utilization data from a single data vendor might not be complete/precise. This is because not all brokers, banks, etc. that lend out shares have necessarily reported their numbers to the data vendor.

"Utilization is defined as loaned shares divided by available shares in the securities lending market, expressed as a percentage."  
"Generally, Utilization is the ratio of demand to supply. For example, Apple Inc. (AAPL) may have utilization of less than 1% because the stock has vast availability relative to the demand to borrow shares for shorting. Roku Inc. (ROKU) may have utilization above 90% because of higher demand to short shares as compared to the number of available shares."

"Utilization:  
The ratio between the number of shares on loan across all outstanding loans in the wholesale market and the number of shares available for lending at lending programs. 0% means that no shares have been borrowed or lent at these lending programs; 100% means that all shares available to borrow or lend at a lending program have, in fact, been lent. This does not represent the number of shares listed on the exchange that have been lent, because not all listed shares are available for lending; it indicates how much of the supply actually available for lending has been lent."
