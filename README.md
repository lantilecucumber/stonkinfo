# About this Repository

This repository contains facts about the GME stock, as well as explanations of concepts and topics from the finance and investing world that commonly occur in [/r/superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/superstonk) threads. All information is provided together with reliable sources.

# Contents

* [Concepts and Terms Explained](https://github.com/lantilecucumber/stonkinfo/blob/main/Concepts%20and%20Terms%20.md)
* [Information regarding the GME Stock](https://github.com/lantilecucumber/stonkinfo/blob/main/GME%20Stock%20Info%20.md)


# Aims
* Provide an accessible place to gather information regarding the stonk in a more structured way.
* Provide a safe place to look up stonk information, reducing the need to rely on information from reddit posts (simply because these understandably lack sources all to often).
* Spare apes some research time, since research could lead to growing wrinkles, eventually resulting in an evolutionary step towards the uranus sapiens. That must be avoided at all cost.

# Contributing

Feel free to provide pull requests, either for an existing issue, or for any content you deem worthy for this repository. It can easily take some days for me to review, but I will do. PRs without sources are not accepted. I am, however, glad about any PR that simply adds more sources to an explained concept.

Mirror and fork this repository as you like. I might also give write access to other apes that I can trust to provide well sauced content.

When you would like to have a concept explained, please open an issue in this repository, or send me a direct message on reddit (/u/lettuchhy).

**When you find any mistakes, please let me know.**
