# Concepts and Terms Explained

### Utilization

Utilization := Number of shares borrowed / Number of shares available to borrow

Note that utilization data from a single data vendor might not be complete/precise. This is because not all brokers, banks, etc. that lend out shares have necessarily reported their numbers to the data vendor.

"Utilization is defined as loaned shares divided by available shares in the securities lending market, expressed as a percentage."  
"Generally, Utilization is the ratio of demand to supply. For example, Apple Inc. (AAPL) may have utilization of less than 1% because the stock has vast availability relative to the demand to borrow shares for shorting. Roku Inc. (ROKU) may have utilization above 90% because of higher demand to short shares as compared to the number of available shares."

"Utilization:  
The ratio between the number of shares on loan across all outstanding loans in the wholesale market and the number of shares available for lending at lending programs. 0% means that no shares have been borrowed or lent at these lending programs; 100% means that all shares available to borrow or lend at a lending program have, in fact, been lent. This does not represent the number of shares listed on the exchange that have been lent, because not all listed shares are available for lending; it indicates how much of the supply actually available for lending has been lent."
